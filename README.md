## Features
* Figure Selection: Users can choose from a list of geometric figures.
* Parameter Input: Each figure page allows users to input the necessary parameters for area and perimeter calculation.
* Error Handling: The app includes rules for required parameters and displays error or warning messages in red if certain conditions are not met.
* Home Button: Each figure page has a home button to return to the home page at any moment.
## Installation
To run the app, ensure you have Python and PyQt5 installed. You can install the required dependencies using the following command:
